          <p>Unity Acupuncture stems from the Buddhist  belief of Ubuntu. Ubuntu is often translated as <strong><em>“I am, because of you.”</em></strong> It embodies the belief that we are all bound together in ways that are invisible to the eye; that there is a oneness to humanity; that we achieve ourselves by sharing ourselves with others, and caring for those around us. At Unity Acupuncture, we aim to cultivate a community of compassion, balance and healing..</p>

          <p>At Unity Acupuncture,we believe that no two people and no two issues are the same. <strong><em>We treat every person and every case as an individual.</em></strong> We work on a holistic level, incorporating practices to heal both the body and mind, bringing them into harmony. Our mission, above all else, is to support our clients in the manner that is best for them.  Because of that, we have cultivated a community of professionals that we will refer out to when necessary.</p>

          <p><h3> Katherine Rohland M.S., L.Ac </h3></p>
          <p><em><h4> Founder, Clinical Director &amp; Licensed Acupuncturist </h4></em></p>

          <p>Katherine Rohland earned her  Masters in Science from Tri-State College of Acupuncture and is a board certified acupuncturist. She also has a background in  physical fitness, having worked as a Personal Trainer for over 6 years and is avid participant of the running and wellness community. What makes Katherine so passionate about acupuncture and chinese medicine is that <strong>chinese medicine offers  solutions for issues that western medicine can not diagnose, or effectively treat.</strong></p>

          <p>Katherine’s passion and drive to study chinese medicine came from her own frustrating experience with a running injury.  While training for a marathon, she developed a severe IT band injury that prevented her from running and got to the point where she could not walk without pain. Her MRI showed that nothing was wrong and the orthopedist could do was provide a temporary solution of a cortisone shot. Katherine tried everything from massage therapy, to physical therapy, to the graston technique, but nothing fixed her pain. With the recommendation of a friend and as a last hope,  Katherine sought out acupuncture. Within 1 visit she could walk without pain and after 3 visits she was back to running. Needless to say, she was hooked. Katherine continued with acupuncture regularly and found resolutions to her chronic fatigue, allergies and sleep problems as well.</p>

          <p>Katherine became an acupuncturist in order to help others who suffer chronic, undiagnosable, or just plan out frustrating problems such as she did. She is dedicated to finding answers for her clients and works with everyone on an individual basis to craft the treatment that is right for them.</p>
