          <h1>Philosophy</h1>

          <p>Unity Acupuncture stems from the Buddhist  belief of Ubuntu. Ubuntu is often translated as <strong><em>“I am, because of you.”</em></strong> It embodies the belief that we are all bound together in ways that are invisible to the eye; that there is a oneness to humanity; that we achieve ourselves by sharing ourselves with others, and caring for those around us. At Unity Acupuncture, we aim to cultivate a community of compassion, balance and healing..</p>

          <p>At Unity Acupuncture,we believe that no two people and no two issues are the same. <strong><em>We treat every person and every case as an individual.</em></strong> We work on a holistic level, incorporating practices to heal both the body and mind, bringing them into harmony. Our mission, above all else, is to support our clients in the manner that is best for them.  Because of that, we have cultivated a community of professionals that we will refer out to when necessary.</p>
