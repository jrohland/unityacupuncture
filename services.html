          <h4>What is Acupuncture?</h4>
          <p>Acupuncture &amp; Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) are based on an understanding of health through balance. Health is a state of optimal balance, where all of your systems are working as they should. The whole system is seen as one, which is why your practitioner may often ask you questions that seem unrelated to your condition. Acupuncture focuses on healing your immediate issue (the branch), while also balancing the” root” to ensure lasting effects. This is why, for example, individuals coming in for muscular pain may also see an improvement in sleep, or digestion. </p>
          <p>Physically, acupuncture is the insertion of very fine needles into specific points in the body to help stimulate natural healing processes. The physicians of ancient China observed that distant parts of the body, including the internal organs, are affected when certain points on the body are stimulated.</p>

          <h2>Moxibustion</h2>
          <p>Moxibustion (moxa) is a form of heat therapy where a small piece of the herb mugwort is burned on or near the surface of the skin. The application of moxa does not hurt. It elicits a nice warming sensation to the point and draws blood and qi to the area. Moxibustion (moxa) is often used in conjunction with acupuncture in order to strengthen the functions of the acupuncture points.</p>
          <p>Moxa is used for many conditions, such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Strengthen the immune system</li>
            <li>Digestive problems</li>
            <li>Treat pain</li>
            <li>Gynecological issues and infertility</li>
