          <h4>What is Acupuncture?</h4>
          <p>Acupuncture &amp; Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) are based on an understanding of health through balance. Health is a state of optimal balance, where all of your systems are working as they should. The whole system is seen as one, which is why your practitioner may often ask you questions that seem unrelated to your condition. Acupuncture focuses on healing your immediate issue (the branch), while also balancing the” root” to ensure lasting effects. This is why, for example, individuals coming in for muscular pain may also see an improvement in sleep, or digestion. </p>
          <p>Physically, acupuncture is the insertion of very fine needles into specific points in the body to help stimulate natural healing processes. The physicians of ancient China observed that distant parts of the body, including the internal organs, are affected when certain points on the body are stimulated.</p>

          <h2><a name="moxibustion"></a>Moxibustion</h2>
          <p>Moxibustion (moxa) is a form of heat therapy where a small piece of the herb mugwort is burned on or near the surface of the skin. The application of moxa does not hurt. It elicits a nice warming sensation to the point and draws blood and qi to the area. Moxibustion (moxa) is often used in conjunction with acupuncture in order to strengthen the functions of the acupuncture points.</p>
          <p>Moxa is used for many conditions, such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Strengthen the immune system</li>
            <li>Digestive problems</li>
            <li>Treat pain</li>
            <li>Gynecological issues and infertility</li>
            <li>Warm the body where cold exists</li>
            <li>Arthritis</li>
            <li>Turning breach babies</li>
          </ul>

          <h2><a name="cupping"></a>Cupping</h2>
          <p>Cupping was developed thousands of years ago and is often used in conjunction with acupuncture, but can also be used alone. One way to think about cupping is that it is the inverse of massage. Rather than applying pressure to muscles, the suction uses pressure to pull skin, tissue and muscles upward.</p>
          <p>Cupping involves placing glass, bamboo or plastic jars on the skin and creating a vacuum by suctioning out the air. The underlying tissue is raised, or sucked, partway into the cup. The purpose of cupping is to enhance circulation, help relieve pain and sore muscles, speed up healing, remove "heat" and pull out the toxins that linger in your body's tissues. Cupping is not painful, but feels more like a strong massage when applied to certain locations.</p>

          <h2><a name="guasha"></a>Guasha</h2>
          <p>Guasha is a form of muscle scrapping. Your practitioner will use a “guasha” tool to make light scraping strokes over a lubricated area of your body.  It is effect on pain, stiffness, fever, chill, cough, wheeze, nausea and vomiting etc. Guasha is used in combination with acupuncture during a treatment when your practitioners determines it is suited. Guasha may leave petechiae and bruising.</p>
