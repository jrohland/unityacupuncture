          <h4><em>What is Acupuncture?</em></h4>
          <p>Acupuncture &amp; Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) are based on an understanding of health through balance. Health is a state of optimal balance, where all of your systems are working as they should. The whole system is seen as one, which is why your practitioner may often ask you questions that seem unrelated to your condition. Acupuncture focuses on healing your immediate issue (the branch), while also balancing the” root” to ensure lasting effects. This is why, for example, individuals coming in for muscular pain may also see an improvement in sleep, or digestion. </p>
          <p>Physically, acupuncture is the insertion of very fine needles into specific points in the body to help stimulate natural healing processes. The physicians of ancient China observed that distant parts of the body, including the internal organs, are affected when certain points on the body are stimulated.</p>

          <h2><a name="moxibustion"></a>Moxibustion</h2>
          <p>Moxibustion (moxa) is a form of heat therapy where a small piece of the herb mugwort is burned on or near the surface of the skin. The application of moxa does not hurt. It elicits a nice warming sensation to the point and draws blood and qi to the area. Moxibustion (moxa) is often used in conjunction with acupuncture in order to strengthen the functions of the acupuncture points.</p>
          <p>Moxa is used for many conditions, such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Strengthen the immune system</li>
            <li>Digestive problems</li>
            <li>Treat pain</li>
            <li>Gynecological issues and infertility</li>
            <li>Warm the body where cold exists</li>
            <li>Arthritis</li>
            <li>Turning breach babies</li>
          </ul>

          <h2><a name="cupping"></a>Cupping</h2>
          <p>Cupping was developed thousands of years ago and is often used in conjunction with acupuncture, but can also be used alone. One way to think about cupping is that it is the inverse of massage. Rather than applying pressure to muscles, the suction uses pressure to pull skin, tissue and muscles upward.</p>
          <p>Cupping involves placing glass, bamboo or plastic jars on the skin and creating a vacuum by suctioning out the air. The underlying tissue is raised, or sucked, partway into the cup. The purpose of cupping is to enhance circulation, help relieve pain and sore muscles, speed up healing, remove "heat" and pull out the toxins that linger in your body's tissues. Cupping is not painful, but feels more like a strong massage when applied to certain locations.</p>

          <h2><a name="guasha"></a>Guasha</h2>
          <p>Guasha is a form of muscle scrapping. Your practitioner will use a “guasha” tool to make light scraping strokes over a lubricated area of your body.  It is effect on pain, stiffness, fever, chill, cough, wheeze, nausea and vomiting etc. Guasha is used in combination with acupuncture during a treatment when your practitioners determines it is suited. Guasha may leave petechiae and bruising.</p>

          <h2><a name="faq"></a>FAQ</h2>

            <p><h4>What is Acupuncture?</p></h4>
            Please see <a href="http://www.unityacupuncturenyc.com/services#acupuncture">“Acupuncture”</a> under services for more information.
 
            <p><h4>Does Acupuncture Hurt?</p></h4>
            No, acupuncture should not hurt. Acupuncture needles are very thin, much thinner than the needles you are used to at a doctor’s office. When receiving acupuncture, you may feel some new “sensations” that you are not used to, but at no point should you feel uncomfortable, or in pain. Your clinician will explain all of this too you and make sure you are comfortable throughout the treatment. 
             
            <p><h4>Does acupuncture leave any marks/bruises?</p></h4>
            Generally, no, the needles are so thin that they do not leave marks. On very rare occasions you may develope a small bruise. This is because (fun fact!)  there is an estimated 10 billion tiny capillaries in the human body. It would be impossible to miss them all 100% of the time. If <a href="http://www.unityacupuncturenyc.com/services#cupping">cupping</a>, or <a href="http://www.unityacupuncturenyc.com/services#guasha"> guasha </a> is used during your treatment, there may leave some marks. Please see the <a href="http://www.unityacupuncturenyc.com/services#cupping"> cupping </a> and <a href="http://www.unityacupuncturenyc.com/services#guasha"> guasha </a> sections for more information. These modalities will not be used without your permission and explaining the results first. 
             
            <p><h4>Are there any side effects to acupuncture?</p></h4>
            If you consider feeling peaceful and relaxed a side effect, then yes! All kidding aside, there are no known side effects to acupuncture besides the occasional bruising mentioned above. Patients will sometimes report feeling a bit drowsy after a treatment and it’s best to take it easily immediately following a treatment. 
             
            At Unity Acupuncture we incorporate a few styles of acupuncture, on of them being trigger point needling to release muscle pain. If this style is used, some soreness is to be expected within the following 24hrs. 
             
            <p><h4>How many sessions do I need for acupuncture to work?</h4></p>
            Every individual and every case is different so the number of treatments and frequency will vary from person to person. Your practitioner will discuss with you a specific timeline for you after your first treatment. In general, you should start to feel some relief after at least 3 treatments. Chronic conditions tend to take longer to heal, whereas more acute conditions will see quicker progress. 
             
            <p><h4>Is acupuncture good for things other than pain?</p></h4>
            YES! Acupuncture can help with a varied of non-pain related issues such as: allergies, nausea, female and male issues, depression, insomnia, anxiety and stress.  
             
            <p><h4>Should I still get acupuncture if I feel fine right now?</p></h4>
            Definitely! Acupuncture was originally developed as preventative medicine. Acupuncture is great for preventing things such as seasonal allergies, ward off colds by boosting your immune system,  menstrual pains/issues, and even sports injuries! Regular acupuncture keeps your system in balance to insure you are in the best of health. 
             
            <p><h4>If I’m getting physical therapy/chiropractic work/massage therapy, can I still get acupuncture too?</p></h4>
            Yes - Acupuncture is not always the “end all, be all" and is sometimes best when used in conjunction with other modalities. We will even refer you to an external practitioner when we feel it is the best thing for you. If you are currently under the care of a physical therapist, chiropractor, medical doctor, or massage therapist, acupuncture can help support their work and often speed up your recovery. 
             
            <p><h4>What should I expect on my first visit?</p></h4>
            Please see <a href="http://www.unityacupuncturenyc.com/appointments#first-visit">“first visit” </a> for a detailed description of your first visit.
